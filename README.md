## 🧩 Problem Statement  
Many individuals struggle to maintain daily productivity due to missed reminders and lack of motivation.  
Existing solutions often require manual setup, complicated integrations, or constant app usage.

---

## 💡 Solution  
A simple, automated **Daily Email Reminder System** built using **WorqHat** and a minimal **web frontend**.  
Users can enter their email and custom reminder message through a simple web page.  
The **backend workflow (WorqHat)** automatically sends a personalized email to the user every day at the scheduled time,  
helping them stay organized and never miss important tasks.

- 🧾 Simple web form for user email and message input.  
- 🤖 WorqHat automation for sending personalized emails automatically.  
- 💬 Dynamic message insertion — users can set their own reminder messages.  
- ✅ Immediate confirmation through frontend and workflow status return.  
- 💻 Fully **no-code backend (WorqHat)** and lightweight **frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
Many individuals struggle to maintain consistency and productivity due to missed reminders or lack of motivation. Existing solutions are often complex, requiring manual setup, app installations, or multiple integrations.

---

## 💡 Solution  
A simple, automated **Daily Email Reminder System** built using **WorqHat** and a minimal **web frontend**.  
Users can enter their email and custom reminder message through a simple web page.  
The **backend workflow (WorqHat)** automatically sends a personalized email to the user every day at the scheduled time,  
helping them stay organized and never miss important tasks.

## 🚀 Features  
- ⏰ Time-based workflow triggers for scheduled daily reminders.  
- 🧾 Simple web form for user email and message input.  
- 🤖 WorqHat automation for sending personalized emails automatically.  
- 💬 Dynamic message insertion — users can set their own reminder messages.  
- ✅ Immediate confirmation through frontend and workflow status return.  
- 💻 Fully **no-code backend (WorqHat)** and lightweight **frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**.  
- 🌐 Easily extensible for team, family, or group reminders.

## 🌈 How It Works
